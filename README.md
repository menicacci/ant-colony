# Ant Colony Simulation 

In this simulation, there are three ant colonies. Their goal is to collect and bring home as much food as possible.

The colonies compete with each other in the search for food sources. Each food source has a finite amount of resources, and when depleted, the ants must find new ones.

While foraging for food, ants release the home pheromone (green), aiding other ants in finding their way back to the nest once food is found. Ants that have located a food source release the food pheromone (red) on their way back home, signaling to other ants the location of the food source.
